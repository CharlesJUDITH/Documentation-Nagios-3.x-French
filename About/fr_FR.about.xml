  <section>

    <para>Nagios is a system and network monitoring application. It watches hosts and 
services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and when they get 
better.</para>

    <para>Nagios was originally designed to run under <ulink 
url="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</ulink>, although it should work under 
most other unices as well.</para>

    <para>Some of the many features of Nagios include:</para>

    <para>The only requirement of running Nagios is a machine running Linux (or UNIX

configured, as most service checks will be performed over the network.</para>

do decide to use them, you will need to have the following software 
installed...</para>
