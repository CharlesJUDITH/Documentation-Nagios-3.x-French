  <title>Active Checks</title>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Nagios is capable of monitoring hosts and services in two ways: actively and 
passively. Passive checks are described <link 
linkend="thebasics-passivechecks">elsewhere</link>, so we'll focus on active 
checks here. Active checks are the most common method for monitoring hosts 
and services. The main features of actives checks as as follows:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Active checks are initiated by the Nagios process</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Active checks are run on a regularly scheduled basis</para>

    <title>How Are Active Checks Performed?</title>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></informalfigure>Active checks are initiated by the check logic in the Nagios daemon. When 
Nagios needs to check the status of a host or service it will execute a 
plugin and pass it information about what needs to be checked. The plugin 
will then check the operational state of the host or service and report the 
results back to the Nagios daemon. Nagios will process the results of the 
host or service check and take appropriate action as necessary (e.g. send 
notifications, run event handlers, etc).</para>

    <title>When Are Active Checks Executed?</title>

    <para>Active check are executed:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>At regular intervals, as defined by the
        <code>check_interval</code> and <code>retry_interval</code> options in your host and service definitions</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>On-demand as needed</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Regularly scheduled checks occur at intervals equaling either the
    <code>check_interval</code> or the <code>retry_interval</code> in your host or service definitions, depending on what <link 
linkend="thebasics-statetypes">type of state</link> the host or service is 
in. If a host or service is in a HARD state, it will be actively checked at 
intervals equal to the <code>check_interval</code> option. If it is in a SOFT state, it will be checked at intervals equal to 
the retry_interval option.</para>

    <para>On-demand checks are performed whenever Nagios sees a need to obtain the 
latest status information about a particular host or service. For example, 
when Nagios is determining the <link 
linkend="thebasics-networkreachability">reachability</link> of a host, it 
will often perform on-demand checks of parent and child hosts to accurately 
determine the status of a particular network segment. On-demand checks also 
occur in the <link linkend="advancedtopics-dependencychecks">predictive 
dependency check</link> logic in order to ensure Nagios has the most 
accurate status information.</para>
