  <title>Passive Host State Translation</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>When Nagios receives passive host checks from remote sources (i.e other 
Nagios instances in distributed or failover setups), the host state reported 
by the remote source may not accurately reflect the state of the host from 
Nagios' view. As distributed and failover monitoring installations are 
fairly common, it is important to provide a mechanism for ensuring accurate 
host states between different instances of Nagios.</para>

    <title>Different World Views</title>

    <para>The image below shows a simplified view of a failover monitoring setup.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Nagios-A</emphasis> is the primary monitoring server, and is 
actively monitoring all switches and routers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Nagios-B</emphasis> and <emphasis>Nagios-C</emphasis> are backup 
monitoring servers, and are receiving passive check results from 
<emphasis>Nagios-A</emphasis></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Both <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> and <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> have 
suffered failures and are offline.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para><informalfigure><mediaobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></informalfigure></para>

    <para>What states are <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> and 
<emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> currently in? The answer depends on which 
Nagios instance you ask.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Nagios-A</emphasis> sees <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> as DOWN and 
<emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> as UNREACHABLE</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Nagios-B</emphasis> should see <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> as 
DOWN and <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> as UNREACHABLE</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Nagios-C</emphasis> should see both routers as being DOWN.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Each Nagios instance has a different view of the network. The backup 
monitoring servers should not blindly accept passive host states from the 
primary monitoring server, or they will have incorrect information on the 
current state of the network.</para>

    <para>Without translating passive host check results from the primary monitoring 
server (<emphasis>Nagios-A</emphasis>), <emphasis>Nagios-C</emphasis> would 
see <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> as UNREACHABLE, when it is really DOWN 
based on its viewpoint. Similarly, the DOWN/UNREACHABLE states (from the 
viewpoint of <emphasis>Nagios-A</emphasis>) for 
<emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> and <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> should be 
flipped from the viewpoint of <emphasis>Nagios-B</emphasis>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>There may be some situations where you do not want Nagios to translate 
DOWN/UNREACHABLE states from remote sources to their <quote>correct</quote> 
state from the viewpoint of the local Nagios instance. For example, in 
distributed monitoring environments you may want the central Nagios instance 
to know how distributed instances see their respective portions of the 
network.</para>
    </note>

  <section>
    <title>Enabling State Translation</title>

    <para>By default, Nagios will not automatically translate DOWN/UNREACHABLE states 
from passive check results. You will need to enable this feature if you need 
and want it.</para>

    <para>The automatic translation of passive host check states is controlled by the 
<link 
linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-translate_passive_host_checks">translate_passive_host_checks</link> 
variable. Enable it and Nagios will automatically translate DOWN and 
UNREACHABLE states from remote sources to their correct state for the local 
instance of Nagios.</para>
