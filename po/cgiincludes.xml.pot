"If you're doing custom installs of Nagios for clients, you may want to have "

"It is important to note that, unless they are executable, custom header and "
"footer files are not pre-processed in any way before they are displayed. The "
"contents of the header and footer include files are simply read and "
"displayed in the CGI output. That means they can only contain information a "
"web browser can understand (HTML, JavaScript, etc.)."

"If the custom header and footer files are executable, then the files are "
"executed and their output returned to the user, so they should output valid "
"HTML. Using this you can run your own custom designed CGI to insert data "
"into the nagios display. This has been used to insert graphs from rrdtool "
"using ddraw and command menus into the nagios display pane. The execuable "
"customer header and footer files are run with the same CGI environment as "
"the main nagios CGI, so your files can parse the query information, "
"authenticated user information, etc. to produce appropriate output."
