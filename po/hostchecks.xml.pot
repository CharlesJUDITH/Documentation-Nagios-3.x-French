"Scheduled host checks are run in parallel. When Nagios needs to run a "

"Hosts which have their <varname>max_check_attempts</varname> value set to 1 "

"determine their true state using the <link linkend=\"thebasics-"
"networkreachability\">network reachability</link> logic (to see if they're "
"DOWN or UNREACHABLE), it will have to launch serial checks of all of the "
"host's immediate parents. Just to reiterate, those checks are run serially, "
"rather than in parallel, so it can cause a big performance hit. For this "
"reason, I would recommend that you always use a value greater than 1 for the "
"max_check_attempts directives in your host definitions."
