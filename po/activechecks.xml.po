"Active checks are initiated by the check logic in the Nagios daemon. When "
"Nagios needs to check the status of a host or service it will execute a "
"plugin and pass it information about what needs to be checked. The plugin "
"will then check the operational state of the host or service and report the "
"results back to the Nagios daemon. Nagios will process the results of the "
"host or service check and take appropriate action as necessary (e.g. send "
"notifications, run event handlers, etc)."
