"If you've forgotten to enter some critical data or misconfigured things, "
"Nagios will spit out a warning or error message that should point you to the "
"location of the problem.  Error messages generally print out the line in the "
"configuration file that seems to be the source of the problem. On errors, "
"Nagios will often exit the pre-flight check and return to the command prompt "
"after printing only the first error that it has encountered.  This is done "
"so that one error does not cascade into multiple errors as the remainder of "
"the configuration data is verified. If you get any error messages you'll "
"need to go and edit your configuration files to remedy the problem. Warning "
"messages can generally be safely ignored, since they are only "
"recommendations and not requirements."
