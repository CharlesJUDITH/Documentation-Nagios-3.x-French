"State \"stalking\" is a feature which is probably not going to used by most "
"users. When enabled, it allows you to log changes in the output service and "
"host checks even if the state of the host or service does not change. When "
"stalking is enabled for a particular host or service, Nagios will watch that "
"host or service very carefully and log any changes it sees in the output of "
"check results. As you'll see, it can be very helpful to you in later "
"analysis of the log files."
