"When Nagios receives passive host checks from remote sources (i.e other "
"Nagios instances in distributed or failover setups), the host state reported "
"by the remote source may not accurately reflect the state of the host from "
"Nagios' view. As distributed and failover monitoring installations are "
"fairly common, it is important to provide a mechanism for ensuring accurate "
"host states between different instances of Nagios."
