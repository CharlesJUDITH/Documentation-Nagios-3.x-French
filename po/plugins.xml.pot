"Unlike many other monitoring tools, Nagios does not include any internal "
"mechanisms for checking the status of hosts and services on your network. "
"Instead, Nagios relies on external programs (called plugins) to do all the "
"dirty work."

msgid ""
"Plugins are compiled executables or scripts (Perl scripts, shell scripts, "
"etc.) that can be run from a command line to check the status or a host or "
"service. Nagios uses the results from plugins to determine the current "
"status of hosts and services on your network."

msgid ""
"Nagios will execute a plugin whenever there is a need to check the status of "
"a service or host. The plugin does something (notice the very general term) "
"to perform the check and then simply returns the results to Nagios. Nagios "
"will process the results that it receives from the plugin and take any "
"necessary actions (running <link linkend=\"advancedtopics-eventhandlers"
"\">event handlers</link>, sending out <link linkend=\"thebasics-notifications"
"\">notifications</link>, etc)."

"The upside of this type of plugin architecture is that you can monitor just "
"about anything you can think of. If you can automate the process of checking "
"something, you can monitor it with Nagios. There are already a lot of "
"plugins that have been created in order to monitor basic resources such as "
"processor load, disk usage, ping rates, etc. If you want to monitor "
"something else, take a look at the documentation on <link linkend="
"\"development-pluginapi\">writing plugins</link> and roll your own.  Its "
"simple!"

"The downside to this type of plugin architecture is the fact that Nagios has "
"absolutely no idea what it is that you're monitoring. You could be "
"monitoring network traffic statistics, data error rates, room temperate, CPU "
"voltage, fan speed, processor load, disk space, or the ability of your super-"
"fantastic toaster to properly brown your bread in the morning... Nagios "
"doesn't understand the specifics of what's being monitored - it just tracks "
"changes in the state of those resources. Only the plugins themselves know "
"exactly what they're monitoring and how to perform the actual checks."
