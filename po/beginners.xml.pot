"Congratulations on choosing Nagios! Nagios is quite powerful and flexible, "
"but it can take a lot of work to get it configured just the way you'd like. "
"Once you become familiar with how it works and what it can do for you, "
"you'll never want to be without it&nbsp;:-) Here are some important things "
"to keep in mind for first-time Nagios users:"

"Don't expect to be able to get things working exactly the way you want them "
"right off the bat. it's not that easy. Setting up Nagios can involve a bit "
"of work - partly because of the options that Nagios offers, partly because "
"you need to know what to monitor on your network (and how best to do it)."

"<emphasis role=\"bold\">Use the quickstart instructions.</emphasis> The "
"<link linkend=\"gettingstarted-quickstart\">Quickstart installation guide</"
"link> is designed to get most new users up and running with a basic Nagios "
"setup fairly quickly. Within 20 minutes you can have Nagios installed and "
"monitoring your local system. Once that's complete, you can move on to "
"learning how to configure Nagios to do more."

"<emphasis role=\"bold\">Read the documentation.</emphasis> Nagios can be "
"tricky to configure when you've got a good grasp of what's going on, and "
"nearly impossible if you don't. Make sure you read the documentation "
"(particularly the sections on <quote>Configuring Nagios</quote> and "
"<quote>The Basics</quote>). Save the advanced topics for when you've got a "
"good understanding of the basics."

"<emphasis role=\"bold\">Seek the help of others.</emphasis> If you've read "
"the documentation, reviewed the sample config files, and are still having "
"problems, send an email message describing your problems to the "
"<email>nagios-users</email> mailing list. Due to the amount of work that I "
"have to do for this project, I am unable to answer most of the questions "
"that get sent directly to me, so your best source of help is going to be the "
"mailing list. If you've done some background reading and you provide a good "
"problem description, odds are that someone will give you some pointers on "
"getting things working properly. More information on subscribing to the "
"mailing lists or searching the list archives can be found at <ulink url="
"\"&url-nagios;support/\">&url-nagios;support/</ulink>."
