"Nagios performs on-demand checks because it need to know the current state "
"of a host or service at that exact moment in time. Utilizing cached checks "
"allows you to make Nagios think that recent check results are <quote>good "

"service."

"The cached check horizon tells Nagios how recent check results must be in "
"order to reliably reflect the current state of a host or service. For "
"example, with a cached check horizon of 30 seconds, you are telling Nagios "

"result of that check should still be considered the current state of the "
"host."

"The number of cached check results that Nagios can use versus the number of "

"a cache hit rate of 100%. In that case all on-demand checks of that host "
"would use cached check results. What a performance improvement! But is it "

"The reliability of cached check result information decreases over time. "
"Higher cache hit rates require that previous check results are considered "

"in any network scenario, and there's no guarantee that a server that was "
"functioning properly 30 seconds ago isn't on fire right now. There's the "
