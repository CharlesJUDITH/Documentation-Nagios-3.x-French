"While the method described in <link linkend=\"advancedtopics-redundancy-"

"notifications if the master monitoring hosts goes down, it does have some "
"pitfalls. The biggest problem is that the slave host is monitoring the same "
"hosts and servers as the master at the same time as the master! This can "
"cause problems with excessive traffic and load on the machines being "
"monitored if you have a lot of services defined. Here's how you can get "
"around that problem..."

"The big problem with the way things have been setup thus far is the fact "
"that the slave host doesn't have the current status of any services or hosts "
"at the time it takes over the job of monitoring. One way to solve this "
"problem is to enable the <link linkend=\"configuringnagios-configmain-"
"ocsp_command\">ocsp command</link> on the master host and have it send all "
"service check results to the slave host using the <link linkend="
"\"nagiosaddons-addons-nsca\">nsca addon</link>.  The slave host will then "
"have up-to-date status information for all services at the time it takes "
"over the job of monitoring things. Since active service checks are not "
"enabled on the slave host, it will not actively run any service checks. "
"However, it will execute host checks if necessary. This means that both the "
"master and slave hosts will be executing host checks as needed, which is not "
"really a big deal since the majority of monitoring deals with service checks."
