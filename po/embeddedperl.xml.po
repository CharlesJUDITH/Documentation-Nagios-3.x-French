"Nagios can be compiled with support for an embedded Perl interpreter. This "
"allows Nagios to execute Perl plugins much more efficiently that it "
"otherwise would, so it may be of interest to you if you rely heavily on "
"plugins written in Perl."

"Without the embedded Perl interpreter, Nagios executes Perl (and non-Perl) "
"plugins by forking and executing the plugins as an external command. When "
"the embedded Perl interpreter is used, Nagios can execute Perl plugins by "
"simply making a library call."

"The embedded Perl interpreter works with all Perl scripts that Nagios "
"executes - not just plugins. This documentation discusses the embedded Perl "
"interpreter in relation to plugins used for host and service checks, but it "

"other types of commands (e.g. notification scripts, event handler scripts, "
"etc.)."

"Nagios will spend much less time running your Perl plugins because it no "

"It greatly reduces the system impact of Perl plugins and/or allows you to "
"run more checks with Perl plugin than you otherwise would be able to. In "
"other words, you have less incentive to write plugins in other languages "
"such as C/C++, or Expect/TCL, that are generally recognised to have "
"development times at least an order of magnitude slower than Perl (although "
"they do run about ten times faster also - TCL being an exception)."

"If you are not a C programmer, then you can still get a huge amount of "
"mileage out of Nagios by letting Perl do all the heavy lifting without "
"having Nagios slow right down.  Note however, that the ePN will not speed up "
"your plugin (apart from eliminating the interpreter load time). If you want "
"fast plugins then consider Perl XSUBs (XS), or C after you are sure that "
"your Perl is tuned and that you have a suitable algorithm (Benchmark.pm is "
"invaluable for comparing the performance of Perl language elements)."
