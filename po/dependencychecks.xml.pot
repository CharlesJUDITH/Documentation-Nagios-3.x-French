"Host and service <link linkend=\"advancedtopics-dependencies\">dependencies</"

"control basic aspects of the monitoring process, it is crucial to ensure "
"that status information used in the dependency logic is as up to date as "
"possible."

"Nagios allows you to enable predictive dependency checks for hosts and "

"The <emphasis>Switch2</emphasis> host in this example has just changed state "
"from an UP state to a problem state. Nagios needs to determine whether the "
"host is DOWN or UNREACHABLE, so it will launch parallel checks of "
"<emphasis>Switch2</emphasis>'s immediate parents (<emphasis>Firewall1</"
"emphasis>) and children (<emphasis>Comp1</emphasis>, <emphasis>Comp2</"
"emphasis>, and <emphasis>Switch3</emphasis>). This is a normal function of "
"the <link linkend=\"thebasics-networkreachability\">host reachability</link> "
"logic."

"You will also notice that <emphasis>Switch2</emphasis> is depending on "
"<emphasis>Monitor1</emphasis> and <emphasis>File1</emphasis> for either "
"notifications or check execution (which one is unimportant in this example). "
"If predictive host dependency checks are enabled, Nagios will launch "
"parallel checks of Monitor1 and File1 at the same time it launches checks of "
"<emphasis>Switch2</emphasis>'s immediate parents and children. Nagios does "
"this because it knows that it will have to test the dependency logic in the "
"near future (e.g. for purposes of notification) and it wants to make sure it "
"has the most current status information for the hosts that take part in the "
"dependency."
