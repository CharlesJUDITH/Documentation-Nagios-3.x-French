"Your monitoring box should be viewed as a backdoor into your other systems. "
"In many cases, the Nagios server might be allowed access through firewalls "
"in order to monitor remote servers. In most all cases, it is allowed to "
"query those remote servers for various information. Monitoring servers are "
"always given a certain level of trust in order to query remote systems. This "
"presents a potential attacker with an attractive backdoor to your systems. "
"An attacker might have an easier time getting into your other systems if "
"they compromise the monitoring server first. This is particularly true if "
"you are making use of shared &protocol-ssh; keys in order to monitor remote "
"systems."

"If an intruder has the ability to submit check results or external commands "
"to the Nagios daemon, they have the potential to submit bogus monitoring "
"data, drive you nuts you with bogus notifications, or cause event handler "
"scripts to be triggered. If you have event handler scripts that restart "
"services, cycle power, etc. this could be particularly problematic."

"Another area of concern is the ability for intruders to sniff monitoring "
"data (status information) as it comes across the wire. If communication "
"channels are not encrypted, attackers can gain valuable information by "
"watching your monitoring information. Take as an example the following "
"situation: An attacker captures monitoring data on the wire over a period of "
"time and analyzes the typical CPU and disk load usage of your systems, along "
"with the number of users that are typically logged into them. The attacker "
"is then able to determine the best time to compromise a system and use its "
"resources (CPU, etc.) without being noticed."

"<emphasis role=\"bold\">Use a Dedicated Monitoring Box</emphasis>.  I would "
"recommend that you install Nagios on a server that is dedicated to "
"monitoring (and possibly other admin tasks). Protect your monitoring server "
"as if it were one of the most important servers on your network. Keep "
"running services to a minimum and lock down access to it via TCP wrappers, "
"firewalls, etc. Since the Nagios server is allowed to talk to your servers "
"and may be able to poke through your firewalls, allowing users access to "
"your monitoring server can be a security risk. Remember, its always easier "
"to gain root access through a system security hole if you have a local "
"account on a box."

"<emphasis role=\"bold\">Lock Down The External Command File</emphasis>. If "
"you enable <xref linkend=\"advancedtopics-extcommands\" />external commands, "
"make sure you set proper permissions on the <filename class=\"directory\">/"
"usr/local/nagios/var/rw directory</filename>. You only want the Nagios user "
"(usually nagios) and the web server user (usually nobody, httpd, apache2, or "
"www-data) to have permissions to write to the command file. If you've "
"installed Nagios on a machine that is dedicated to monitoring and admin "
"tasks and is not used for public accounts, that should be fine. If you've "
"installed it on a public or multi-user machine (not recommended), allowing "
"the web server user to have write access to the command file can be a "
"security problem. After all, you don't want just any user on your system "
"controlling Nagios through the external command file. In this case, I would "
"suggest only granting write access on the command file to the nagios user "
"and using something like <ulink url=\"http://cgiwrap.sourceforge.net/"
"\">CGIWrap</ulink> to run the CGIs as the nagios user instead of nobody."

"necessary. Instructions on setting up authentication and configuring "
