"First off, we need to define what we mean by a \"cluster\". The simplest way "
"to understand this is with an example. Let's say that your organization has "
"five hosts which provide redundant &protocol-dns; services to your "
"organization. If one of them fails, its not a major catastrophe because the "
"remaining servers will continue to provide name resolution services.  If "
"you're concerned with monitoring the availability of &protocol-dns; service "
"to your organization, you will want to monitor five &protocol-dns; servers. "
"This is what I consider to be a service cluster. The service cluster "
"consists of five separate &protocol-dns; services that you are monitoring. "
"Although you do want to monitor each individual service, your main concern "
"is with the overall status of the &protocol-dns; service cluster, rather "
"than the availability of any one particular service."

"If your organization has a group of hosts that provide a high-availability "
"(clustering) solution, I would consider those to be a host cluster. If one "
"particular host fails, another will step in to take over all the duties of "

"Monitoring individual host or service cluster elements is easier than you "
"think.  In fact, you're\tprobably already doing it. For service clusters, "
"just make sure that you are monitoring each service element of the cluster. "
"If you've got a cluster of five &protocol-dns; servers, make sure you have "
"five separate service definitions (probably using the &plugin-dns; plugin).  "
"For host clusters, make sure you have configured appropriate host "
"definitions for each member of the cluster (you'll also have to define at "

"You're going to want to disable notifications for the individual cluster "

"Monitoring the overall cluster can be done by using the previously cached "

"Cached results for cluster elements can be found in the <link linkend="

"Monitoring host clusters is very similiar to monitoring service clusters. "
"Obviously, the main difference is that the cluster members are hosts and not "
"services. In order to monitor the status of a host cluster, you must define "
"a service that uses the &plugin-cluster; plugin. The service should not be "
"associated with any of the hosts in the cluster, as this will cause problems "
"with notifications for the cluster if that host goes down. A good idea might "
"be to associate the service with the host that Nagios is running on. After "
"all, if the host that Nagios is running on goes down, then Nagios isn't "
"running anymore, so there isn't anything you can do as far as monitoring "
"(unless you've setup <link linkend=\"advancedtopics-redundancy\">redundant "
