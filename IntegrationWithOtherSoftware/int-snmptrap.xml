    <note>
      <para>Nagios is not designed to be a replacement for a full-blown &protocol-snmp;
      management application like HP OpenView or <ulink
      url="http://www.opennms.org/">OpenNMS</ulink>. However, you can set
      things up so that &protocol-snmp; traps received by a host on your network can
      generate alerts in Nagios.</para>
    </note>

    <para>As if designed to make the Gods of Hypocrisy die of laughter, &protocol-snmp;
    is anything but simple. Translating &protocol-snmp; traps and getting them into
    Nagios (as passive check results) can be a bit tedious. To make this task
    easier, I suggest you check out Alex Burger's &protocol-snmp; Trap Translator project
    located at <ulink
    url="http://www.snmptt.org/">http://www.snmptt.org</ulink>. When combined
    with Net-&protocol-snmp;, SNMPTT provides an enhanced trap handling system that can
    be integrated with Nagios.</para>

    <para>Yep, that's all.</para>
